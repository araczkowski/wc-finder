# WC Finder

A modern web application for finding and managing public restrooms with advanced location features.

## Features

- üöΩ **WC Management**: Add, edit, and delete public restroom locations
- üîç **Smart Address Search**: Intelligent address autocomplete with GPS coordinates
- üìç **Location Services**: Automatic GPS detection and reverse geocoding
- ‚≠ê **Rating System**: Rate and review restrooms (1-10 stars)
- üñºÔ∏è **Photo Gallery**: Upload and view multiple photos for each location
- üë§ **User Authentication**: Secure login with Google OAuth or email/password
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- üåç **Polish Localization**: Optimized for Polish addresses and language

## Address Autocomplete & GPS Features

The application includes advanced address input with:

- **Smart Autocomplete**: Real-time address suggestions as you type
- **Automatic GPS Coordinates**: Coordinates retrieved automatically from addresses
- **Dual API Support**: Google Places API with OpenStreetMap fallback
- **Polish Address Support**: Optimized for Polish addresses and special characters
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility

### Optional Google Maps Integration

For enhanced address autocomplete, you can configure Google Maps API:

```bash
# Optional - Add to .env.local for enhanced address features
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
```

Without Google Maps API, the application automatically uses OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) as a fallback.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your configuration:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# NextAuth Configuration (Required)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# Google OAuth (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Google Maps API (Optional - for enhanced address features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Image Search Configuration (Optional)
ENABLE_IMAGE_SEARCH=true
IMAGE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT=10000
IMAGE_SEARCH_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

## Enhanced Image System

The application includes an intelligent image system for importing WC locations:

- **Contextual Image Selection**: Uses smart algorithms to select appropriate images based on location type
- **Multiple Fallback Sources**: Falls back to Bing Images for real location photos when available
- **High-Quality Placeholders**: Uses curated, high-quality placeholder images from Unsplash
- **Consistent Image Selection**: Same locations always get the same placeholder image for consistency
- **Type-Specific Images**: Different image sets for restaurants, cafes, public buildings, etc.
- **Configurable**: Can be disabled or configured via environment variables

### Image Search Configuration

```bash
# Enable/disable image search (default: true)
ENABLE_IMAGE_SEARCH=true

# Search timeout in milliseconds (default: 10000)
IMAGE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT=10000

# Maximum search retries (default: 3)
IMAGE_SEARCH_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

The enhanced image system works by:
1. First attempting to find real photos of the location using Bing Images
2. Creating contextual search queries based on place name, address, and location type
3. For toilets, it searches for the building/location rather than generic toilet images
4. Falls back to curated, high-quality placeholder images that match the location type
5. Uses consistent image selection so the same place always gets the same image
6. Provides multiple image variants for each place type to avoid repetition
